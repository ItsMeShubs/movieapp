# Movie Explorer

## About The Project

Movie Explorer is a web application I developed as my first project with Svelte and SvelteKit. It marks the beginning of my journey into modern web development, focusing on learning and applying new technologies. This project showcases popular movies using The Movie Database (TMDb) API, offering a platform for movie enthusiasts to explore and discover trending cinematic works.

### Why I Built Movie Explorer

- **Learning and Growth**: To challenge myself and deepen my understanding of Svelte, SvelteKit, and web development in general.
- **API Integration**: To gain hands-on experience in integrating external APIs and handling dynamic data.
